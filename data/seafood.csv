crab,Dungeness Crab,"Toxic algal blooms delayed the 2015 season until March 2016. Though it’s too early to say for sure whether the season will open on time this year, ocean conditions have certainly improved. But because algal blooms are becoming more persistent and frequent, there is concern that future seasons will often have to deal with threats of closure or abbreviation. Crab is also affected by ocean acidification.","November through June","<p>The commercial Dungeness crab fishery can be traced to the mid-1800s in San Francisco. While it’s had plenty of ups and downs, last year was devastating for many crabbers, in an unprecedented way. A bloom of pseudo-nitzschia, a type of algae that is common in early fall but usually goes away in time for crab season, stretched from Southern California to Alaska. Caused by unusually warm ocean temperatures, the bloom resulted in levels of domoic acid toxic to humans in Dungeness crab all along the California coast.</p><p>The season was delayed until March, which meant no local crab at Thanksgiving, Christmas and dozens of annual crab feeds, a Northern California tradition.</p><p>There have been pockets of pseudo-nitzschia in the ocean this fall, but this time at a normal level. However, public health officials say it is still too early to make any definitive predictions regarding the season.</p><p>Dungeness crab, though, face another long-term threat: ocean acidification. NOAA Fisheries’ Northwest Fisheries Science Center research shows crab eggs and larvae exposed to more acidic water have slower growth and greater loss. There’s also research indicating that ocean acidification could increase the toxicity of algal blooms like pseudo-nitzschia.</p>",,,,,
salmon,Chinook Salmon,"Drought and warm river conditions impede reproduction and salmon’s ability to make the journey from river to ocean and back again. Some runs of salmon face extinction.",May through September and part of October,"<p>The five-year drought has had a dramatic impact on this already challenged population of native fish. Salmon caught by local fishers outside of the Golden Gate are part of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta system, which has four different seasonal spawning runs. The salmon that reach our markets are the fall and late-fall run, migrating from July to December and mid-October to December.</p><p>Most native salmon’s original spawning grounds have been disrupted by dams in the river system, so they are dependent on two factors: how much it rains and/or the amount of water that state officials decide to release into the river during drought. When the river water was too warm in 2014 and 2015, 95 percent of winter-run baby and juvenile salmon died.</p><p>Salmon take several years to mature, which means that during the last few salmon seasons the fish were born under traumatic conditions. The 2016 season, which just ended, was also hampered by the late crab season, which kept gear and crabbers out in the water later.</p><p>The Bay Institute, along with Natural Resources Defense Council and other organizations, has been working since 1998 to reconnect part of the San Joaquin River to San Francisco Bay that had been disconnected since the 1950s. When the restoration is complete, it could restore the runs of 30,000 spring and fall-run salmon every year.</p>","./assets/graphics/salmon_map.png","Loss of salmon habitat in the Central Valley","Historic salmon spawning grounds in the Central Valley have been cut off by dams and other impassable barriers, making it difficult for adult salmon to lay eggs and for the babies to make their way to the ocean. The Bay Institute, along with other organizations, has been working for two decades to reconnect part of the San Joaquin river to the San Francisco Bay after having been disconnected for 70 years.",The Bay Institute,http://bay.org/divisions/the-bay-institute/
oyster,Farmed Oysters,"Ocean acidification is killing and deforming oyster seed and baby oysters by making it difficult for oysters and other shellfish to properly develop shells.","Year-round","<p>Starting around 2010, John Finger and Terry Sawyer at Hog Island Oyster Co. were not able to order enough seeds to cultivate the usual amount of oysters they produce at their Tomales Bay farm. The three hatcheries that supply West Coast oyster farms were losing half of their seed to a new culprit: ocean acidification, caused by changes in pH acid levels in the ocean as it absorbs excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p><p>In subsequent years, Hog Island has set up a small lab to monitor temperature, salinity and carbon dioxide levels in the bay, working with Tessa Hill of the UC Davis Bodega Marine Lab. The real-time information can help the company decide optimum times to grow oysters and is available to scientists anywhere.</p><p>Hill’s lab is also is researching how eelgrass, which thrives in Tomales Bay, can help absorb excess carbon dioxide underwater, the way trees do on land.</p><p>Hog Island is in the middle of building a $3 million hatchery in Humboldt Bay, where it will grow its own seed and then raise young oysters in a nursery that already supplies its farm in Tomales Bay. The goal is to breed oysters that can better withstand acidic conditions.</p>",,,,,
sardines,Pacific Sardine,"A population crash has kept the fishery closed for two years. It will be reassessed in early 2017, and if it rebounds enough, it can reopen in the spring.","Usually year-round","<p>The Bay Area doesn’t normally see much of the Pacific sardine catch, which goes mainly to the global commodity market as a canned product or for fish feed. But it can sometimes be the most abundant species on the coast, and in 2007 its catch brought $8.2 million to the state.</p><p>But the current population — estimated at a biomass of around 106,000 metric tons — is only one-tenth of what it was in 2007. That’s because the species seems to be at the low end of its typical boom and bust cycle, and well below the cutoff level of 150,000 metric tons that triggers the fishery’s closure. The cutoff ensures the population recovers and that it’s available to predators like sea lions, who have been dying of starvation in large numbers.</p><p>Overfishing caused a similar crash in the 1950s, devastating Monterey’s sardine-dependent economy. After limits were put in place in the 1970s, the population recovered and was healthy again by the 1990s.</p>",,,,,
squid,Squid,"El Niño and the “Warm Blob” of ocean water have caused squid populations to migrate and spawn much farther north than usual, lowering the state’s harvest.",April to October,"<p>Market squid can be found anywhere from Mexico to Canada, but they almost always spawn off of California. Last year, squid eggs were found in Alaska waters as squid followed cooler, more nutrient-rich water up the coast. The state’s harvest dropped by 64 percent between 2014 and 2015, though Northern California’s portion of the catch has been higher than usual.</p><p>“Historically, overall catches decrease during El Niño but then rebound with the increased upwelling of cooler La Niña phases,” said Kirk Lynn, environmental scientist at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p><p>Lynn said this year’s expected La Niña, a cooling trend that usually follows El Niño, could make squid more abundant overall and keep it in a more normal range next season. But if the Warm Blob lingers, squid may continue to show unusual movement or become completely unavailable.</p>","./assets/graphics/squidlandings_2000_2014_web2.gif","Squid are migrating northward","El Niño and the Warm Blob caused squid populations to move and spawn in usual places, greatly decreasing the state harvest in 2015. Before that, catch of the coastal pelagic species showed a gradual but notable movement up the coast, especially between 2010 and 2014, the year the Blob began. (Some changes in where the catch happened also depended on where specialized unloading equipment was available and fishers were able to unload their catch.)",California Department of Fish and Wildlife,https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/
seaurchin,North Coast Red Sea Urchin,"Northern California urchin are starving due to declining kelp forests and competition with purple sea urchin. They also face ocean acidification.","Year-round","<p>California’s red sea urchin fishery is based mostly in Southern California, but the Northern California industry still brought in $3 million in 2013, mostly to small North Coast towns. With the harvest at 10 percent of what it was then, Fort Bragg sea urchin processor Bob Juntz of Ocean Fresh Seafood is having his worst year since opening in 1984.</p><p>Urchins must be harvested by hand, and divers are finding urchin shells practically empty where they normally gather them, or diving to unsafe depths to find ones they can sell. In addition to a lack of kelp, there is also an overabundance of purple sea urchin, which Catton estimates is at 60 times its normal population. Without much of a commercial market or real predators, the purple urchin are stripping the kelp that’s left, which is having an impact on red abalone too.</p><p>Aerial monitoring of kelp growth on the North Coast has shown that it dropped by 93 percent between 2008 and 2014. Catton was hoping that kelp would grow back this year because of La Niña, but so far it’s been patchy.</p><p>“We’re in a waiting mode really. We’re just taking what we can and waiting for the kelp to grow back,” said Juntz. “It’s no fun.”</p>",,,,,
