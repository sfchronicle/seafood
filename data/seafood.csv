crab,Dungeness Crab,"toxic algal blooms, ocean acidification",November through June,"The season opens as usual, with no delays or closures.","<p>Warming ocean temperatures cause more persistent toxic algal blooms that regularly close or shorten the season. Meanwhile, ocean acidification reduces crab populations.</p><p>The commercial Dungeness crab fishery can be traced back to the mid 1800s in San Francisco. Last year, it had a devastating year. A bloom of pseudo-nitzschia, a type of algae that is common in the Pacific but usually goes away in time for crab season, stretched all the way from Southern California to Alaska.</p><p>Caused by unusually warm ocean temperatures from the Marine Heat Wave, the bloom resulted in toxic levels of domoic acid in many marine shellfish species, including Dungeness crab up and down the California coast, delaying the season opening until March. That meant no crab at Thanksgiving, Christmas, dozens of crab feeds or even Super Bowl and about half of the usual catch overall.</p><p>This fall, there have been pockets of pseudo-nitzschia, but at a more normal level for the time of year. For now, it seems to have dissipated and the outlook is considerably rosier for a good crab season.</p><p>Unfortunately, domoic acid isn't the only issue threatening crab long-term. Ocean acidification, which is caused when excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is absorbed by the ocean, makes it difficult for shellfish to properly develop shells. NOAA Fisheries' Northwest Fisheries Science Center published research slower growth and a higher loss to crab eggs and larvae that were exposed to higher acidity in the water. Early research has indicated that increased ocean acidification could also increase the toxicity of algal blooms like pseudo-nitzschia; however it's still too early to know.</p>",,
salmon,Chinook Salmon,drought and warm river conditions impede reproduction and salmon's ability to follow their journey from river to ocean and back again,May through September and part of October,"Salmon bounce back, TK TK. more waterways reconnected to give them access to historic habitat","<p>Winter-run salmon become extinct.</p><p>The five-year drought has had a dramatic impact on this already challenged population of native fish. The salmon caught by local fishers outside of the Golden Gate are part of the Sacramento-San Joachin River system, which has four different seasonal runs 'winter, spring, fall and late-fall' named for the time of year that adult salmon make the journey from the ocean back up the river to their spawning grounds. The salmon that reach our markets are the fall run, which migrate back up the river from July to December and the late-fall run, which migrate mid-October to December.</p><p>Most native salmon's original spawning grounds have been disrupted by dams in the river system, so they are dependent on how much it rains or the amount of water that state officials decide to release into the river during drought. During drought, this system can get disrupted. Babies and juveniles die in vast numbers if the river water they inhabit is too warm, which happened to 95 percent of winter-run salmon in 2014 and 2015. That was partly because water officials decided to release water into the river for farms earlier in the year, rather than to wait to release in spring, when salmon spawn. Winter-run salmon have been considered endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act since 1994.</p><p>Salmon take several years to mature, which means that during the last few salmon seasons the fish were born under traumatic conditions. In 2014 and 2015, much of the fall-run salmon had been born in hatcheries and trucked to the ocean rather than allowed to swim downriver in dangerous drought conditions. The 2016 season, which just ended, was hampered by the late crab season, which kept gear and crabbers out in the water later; it was also limited to protect winter-run salmon.</p><p>'We're still living off basically drought survivors,' said John McManus of the Golden Gate Salmon Association. But he thinks populations will rebound in coming years, especially if the drought continues to improve. He also sees promise in his organization's efforts to increasingly truck baby salmon from their hatcheries down to the ocean, where they seem to do better than when they're released into the river.</p><p>Another big improvement is being made to salmon river habitat. The Bay Institute, along with Natural Resources Defense Council and other organizations, has been working since 1998 to reconnect part of the San Joaquin river to the San Francisco Bay that had been disconnected since the 1950s. When the restoration is eventually completed, it should restore the runs of 30,000 spring and fall-run salmon every year.</p>",,
oyster,Farmed Oysters,ocean acidification is killing and deforming oyster seed and baby oysters,year round,Growers like Hog Island Oyster Co. will find ways to breed babies that can better withstand acidic ocean conditions.,"<p>Oyster growers continue to lose sources of seed.</p><p>Starting back in 2010 or so, John Finger and Terry Sawyer at Hog Island Oyster Co. were not able to order enough seeds to cultivate all the oysters they wanted to produce at their Tomales Bay farm. That's because the three hatcheries that supply West Coast oyster farms had starting losing half of their seed to a new culprit: ocean acidification.</p><p>Caused by changes in pH in the ocean as it absorbs excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, ocean acidification makes it difficult for oysters and other shellfish to properly develop shells, especially at the very beginning of life. In the years since, Hog Island has set up a small lab at its farm to monitor temperature, salinity and carbon dioxide levels in the bay, working with Tessa Hill of UC Davis's Bodega Marine Lab. The real-time information can help the company decide optimum times to grow oysters and is available to scientists anywhere.</p><p>'For us, scientifically, this monitoring adds to our growing knowledge about the threat of ocean acidification on the Northern California coast,' said Hill.</p><p>Hill's lab is also is looking into whether eelgrass, an underwater plant that thrives in Tomales Bay, can help absorb excess carbon dioxide like trees do in the air.</p><p>Hog Island is in the middle of building a $3 million hatchery in Humboldt Bay, where it will grow its own seed and then raise the babies in a nursery that already supplies its farm in Tomales Bay. Part of the goal is to breed oysters that can better withstand acidic conditions.</p><p>'Unless you have your head in the sand you realize this is going to get drastically worse,' said Finger. 'We need to have more seed production in various places because we don't know what the patterns are for this.'</p>",,
sardines,Pacific Sardine,Population crash has kept the fishery closed for two years,Usually year-round,"After the population is reassessed in early 2017, it goes above the population cutoff and reopens next spring.","<p>The population stays below the cutoff and the fishery remains closed.</p><p>The West Coast Pacific sardine fishery has been closed for two years. While most of the catch goes into the global commodity market, either canned or for fish feed, in 2007, it brought $8.2 million to the state and can sometimes be the most abundant species on the coast.</p><p>Problem is, the current population is only one-tenth of what it was in 2007. That's because the fish seems to be at the low end of a typical boom and bust cycle. Estimated at a population biomass of around 106,000 metric tons, it's below the cutoff of 150,000 metric tons, triggering the closure of the fishery.</p><p>'That is to ensure there is a core population to help the stock recover, and to ensure there are sardine available for general ecosystem needs,' said Kerry Griffin, staff officer for coastal pelagic species at Pacific Fisheries Management Council. The sardine population collapse has also had an impact on sea lion pups, for example, who have been dying of starvation in large numbers.</p><p>One theory about the decline is that colder ocean temperatures from 2010 to 2014 led to the loss of of sardine eggs and babies, resulting in a smaller adult population that could rebound with the warmer water temperatures of recent years. Some also say that fishing should have been stopped earlier to prevent the collapse.</p><p>There was a similar crash in the 1950s due to overfishing, causing devastation in Monterey's sardine-dependent economy. After limits were put in place in the 1970s, the population recovered and was healthy again by the 1990s.</p><p> 'A big problem in the Cannery Row days was that as the population was declining, the fishing continued at a high rate. We've learned that lesson,' said Griffin. The next assessment will be in early 2017, and the council will decide by April whether the population has recovered enough to allow fishing to reopen.</p>",,
squid,Squid,"El Ni'o and the blob cause squid populations to move and spawn in usual places, lowering the overall harvest",April to October,Coastal water stays normal and squid returns to normal patterns,"<p>Marine heat wave causes squid to swim to deeper, cooler water, out of range of fishers.</p><p>Market squid can be found anywhere from Mexico to Canada, but they almost always spawn off of California. Last year, squid eggs were found in Alaska waters. The species is highly sensitive to water temperature changes, because warmer water means the water has fewer nutrients, and tends to have a lower population during El Ni'o years. That's why the harvest dropped 64 percent between 2014 and 2015 in the state. </p><p>'Historically, overall catches decrease during El Ni'o but then rebound with the increased upwelling of cooler La Ni'a phases,' said Kirk Lynn, environmental scientist at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 'During warm water events with nutrient-poor water, landings can disappear entirely in some areas.' </p><p>Ironically, El Ni'o was good to the Northern California squid market even though it lowered the state's overall catch. The additional influence of the Marine Heat Wave pushed squid north, making the commercial catch much higher in Northern California than usual during the 2014 and 2015 seasons, and in 2016. </p><p>'There's just miles of squid out there,' said Larry Collins of the San Francisco Community Fishing Association at Pier 45 in San Francisco, who said that where the squid lands also depends on which ports have pumps and other specialized equipment to unload the squid and then truck it to a plant for processing. </p><p>Collins showed up at Pier 45 at midnight several nights early this month to receive ton after ton of squid, caught in the dark near the Farallons or closer to shore. 'They'll bite on the islands and they'll start spawning at the beach in Marin and up the point.' </p><p>Lynn said this year's La Ni'a could make squid more abundant overall and keep it in a more normal range next season. But if the Marine Heat Wave lingers, squid may continue to show unusual movement. </p><p> 'It's also possible squid may be unavailable to the fishery due to movement to deeper colder waters, as the fishery conducts operations in relatively shallow depths,' said Lynn.</p>",,
seaurchin,North Coast Red Sea Urchin,Northern California urchin are starving due to declining kelp forests and competition with purple sea urchin; ocean acidification,year round,More kelp grows next year and divers help remove purple urchin to help fishery recover.,"<p>Divers stop catching urchin because they're aren't enough worth harvesting.</p><p>California's red sea urchin fishery is mostly based in Southern California, but the Northern California industry provides a livelihood for plenty of people in small North Coast towns, where it brought in $3 million in 2013. But this year, between January and June, the harvest was at 10 percent of what it was in 2013 and 2014. </p><p> 'The reason is not because there aren't urchins out there,' said Cynthia Catton of the Invertebrate Management Project at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 'But that they're not full of any gonad that people eat. The uni isn't in them. It's not worth it.' </p><p>Urchins must be harvested by hand, and divers are having to go to unsafe depths to find ones that are full of uni, or gonads, the edible part, Catton said. That's because there is barely any kelp for the urchins to eat, which makes them not develop fully. Again the culprit is the recent warmer ocean temperatures. Kelp is an annual plant that develops fully during spring upwellings, when nutrient-rich waters spur its growth. </p><p>Making things worse is an overabundance of purple sea urchin, which Catton's team estimates is at 60 times its normal population. Without much of a commercial market or real predators, it is are clearing the kelp from the ocean floor like vacuum cleaners, which is having an impact on red abalone too. </p><p>There are efforts to find uses for the purple urchins to encourage divers to catch them and reduce the population. </p><p>Catton was hoping that kelp would grow back this year, because of La Nina, but so far it's been patchy. Aerial monitoring of kelp growth on the North Coast had already shown a 93 percent drop between 2008 and 2014. She is worried that without enough urchin worth catching, the divers will just stop.</p>",,
